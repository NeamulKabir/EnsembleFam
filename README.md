EnsembleFam: Towards a more accurate protein function prediction in twilight zone

EnsembleFam aims at better function prediction for proteins in the twilight zone. EnsembleFam extracts the core characteristics of a protein family
using similarity and dissimilarity features calculated from sequence homology relations. EnsembleFam trains three separate Support Vector Machine (SVM) 
classifiers for each family using these features, and an ensemble prediction is made to classify novel proteins into these families.
